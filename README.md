# SGI Api

Hi! This is SGI an API that supports crud for Products, on the near future 
we hope to support more services !

# Documentation
For know the documentation is within the same project so... you'll need to run
it to see it üòû  
The upside of this is that this project is too easy to run with docker! üê≥  
so... run it and go to the swagger http://localhost:8000/docs#

# How To Run Locally

1) you need to place the env ENVIRONMENT=LOCAL  
2) Run your local database at localhost:5432
3) Replace the following files 
   * **sgi/secrets/pg.ini**: represents postgres connection. i.e: DATABASE_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://sgi:password@localhost:5432/sgi"
   * **sgi/alembic.ini**: represents the connection to de DB but for migrations
     * **Note**: the sqlalchemy.url will be ignored, alembic will be automatically 
     connected to localhost:5432 if you want to change this behavior see **How To Run Remotely**
4) run `alembic -c /secrets/alembic.ini upgrade head` : this runs migrations
5) run `poetry run fastapi run src/main.py`  : this runs the project
